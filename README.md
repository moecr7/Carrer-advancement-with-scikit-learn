# Career Advancement with Scikit-Learn

This repository focuses on leveraging Scikit-Learn for career advancement with 0.95 accuracy through practical machine learning applications.

## Repository Contents
This repository includes:

- **Profile Dataset (CSV)**: A dataset containing user demographics, career preferences, and skills, aimed at assisting in career development strategies.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: A notebook that demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques using the provided dataset.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to enhance your machine learning skills and provide you with tools for advancing your career. By using the available resources and code examples, you can develop a better understanding of machine learning concepts and apply these skills to real-world projects.

## Installation
To use this repository, you will need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the Scikit-Learn library:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

You will also need Jupyter Notebook, which can be installed using:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Getting Started
To get started, check out the CSV file and Jupyter Notebook. The code within the notebook will guide you through various machine learning methods and how to apply them to the dataset.
